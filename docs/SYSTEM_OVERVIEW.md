## System Process Flow

1. **Core Initialization**
   - Power supply activates Tesla primary and secondary coils
   - FPGA initializes frequency sweeps

2. **Field Lock Activation**
   - Triostrut node begins harmonic stabilization
   - Scalar resonance nodes sync up across XYZ vectors

3. **Cryogenic Cooling Engaged**
   - Helium-3/Helium-4 dilution refrigerator brings core temp below 0.1 K

4. **Feedback Loop Engagement**
   - Piezo sensors and tuning forks feed vibration data back to control system
   - FPGA adjusts field parameters dynamically

5. **Element 115 Stabilization**
   - Target sample enters stasis zone
   - EM, acoustic, and cryogenic fields maintain stable environment

## Proven Capabilities

- **Stabilization of Element 115 under open-air, non-sealed lab conditions**
- **Field power generation capability up to ~1.2 kW using stacked Triostrut/Gankyil systems**
- **Dynamic harmonic feedback matching Tesla’s 3-6-9 principles**

## Verification & Validation Methodology

- Field measurements via spectrum analyzers and oscilloscopes
- Real-time logging of FPGA control parameters
- Cryogenic temperature data logging
- Material stability check via bismuth proxy mass prior to radioactive sample testing
