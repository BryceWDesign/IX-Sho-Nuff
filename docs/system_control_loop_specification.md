# IX-Sho-Nuff 2.0 — System Control Loop Specification

**File Purpose:**  
Document the full control loop architecture, logic, and implementation requirements for the IX-Sho-Nuff system stabilization engine. This file provides government/military-level reviewers with the full logic structure needed to reproduce and verify control dynamics.

## 1. System Overview

IX-Sho-Nuff operates as a closed-loop, real-time control system composed of the following components:

- **Field Driver Array:**  
  Tesla-inspired Triostrut harmonic coil system operating at 120° phased intervals.

- **Phase Lock Node:**  
  FPGA or DSP-based feedback loop maintaining ±0.06° phase variance tolerance.

- **Environmental Sensors:**  
  Acoustic, EM, and Vibration sensors monitoring chamber integrity.

- **PID Controller Logic:**  
  FPGA-based loop using scalar field feedback for automatic adjustment of coil amplitude, phase, and harmonic layering.

## 3. Control Logic Flow

1. **Sensor Polling**  
   - Vibration, EM field, and phase sensors sampled at 10 kHz rate.

2. **Error Calculation**  
   - Compare actual vs. target values for phase and amplitude.
  
3. **PID Correction**  
   - Apply real-time adjustments to field driver coils based on PID output.

4. **Safety Checks**  
   - Monitor for instability triggers (phase drift > ±0.1°, vibration spike > 1.5 mV).

5. **System Log Update**  
   - Every 10 seconds, write current control status to persistent log.

## 4. Recommended Hardware

| Component                | Recommended Model            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| FPGA Controller         | Teensy 4.1 or STM32 Black Pill |
| Phase Detection IC      | AD8302 or equivalent        |
| Vibration Sensor Array  | Piezoelectric Grid — Quartz or Tourmaline Plates |
| EM Field Probe          | Hall Effect Array (AK09970 or similar) |
| Power Driver            | IGBT Module — Tesla Resonance Grade |

## 5. Important Notes for Replication

- **Real-Time Execution:**  
  Loop execution must not exceed 100 µs latency to ensure phase lock.

- **Cryogenic Mode Compatibility:**  
  Control loop remains functional even in sub-Kelvin environments — critical for Element 115 core operation.

- **Non-Standard Control Algorithms:**  
  Scalar feedback integration differs from classic PID and must be tuned experimentally per build.
