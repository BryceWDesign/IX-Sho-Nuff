# IX-Sho-Nuff 2.0 — System Control Loop Specification

**File Purpose:**  
Define the exact functional parameters, algorithm logic, and hardware setup required to operate IX-Sho-Nuff's field stabilization control system. This system ensures precise phase lock, vibration dampening, and field resonance targeting.

## 1. Control System Overview

- **Primary Hardware:**  
  - FPGA or High-Speed Microcontroller (Teensy 4.1 or STM32F4 recommended)  
  - Piezoelectric Sensor Grid (for acoustic feedback)  
  - Phase Array Coil Drivers (3x Tesla Coil Drivers)  
  - Cryogenic Temperature Sensors (0.01 K precision)

- **Control Loop Type:**  
  - PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Feedback Control  

- **Target Control Variables:**  
  - Node Phase Angle (degrees)  
  - Acoustic Resonance Frequency (Hz)  
  - Scalar Field Amplitude (V)  
  - Temperature Stabilization (Kelvin)

## 2. PID Control Loop Pseudocode

```plaintext
Initialize System
Set Phase_Lock_Target = 120°
Set Resonance_Frequency_Target = 14.3 kHz
Set Scalar_Field_Amplitude_Target = 7.2–9.72 MHz band
Set Temperature_Target = 0.1 K

WHILE System_Active:
    Read Current_Phase_Angle from Sensor_Array
    Read Current_Resonance_Frequency
    Read Current_Temperature
    Read Current_Field_Amplitude

    Calculate Error Values:
        Phase_Error = Phase_Lock_Target - Current_Phase_Angle
        Resonance_Error = Resonance_Frequency_Target - Current_Resonance_Frequency
        Temperature_Error = Temperature_Target - Current_Temperature
        Amplitude_Error = Scalar_Field_Amplitude_Target - Current_Field_Amplitude

    Apply PID Correction:
        Adjust Coil Driver Phasing
        Adjust Acoustic Driver Output
        Adjust Scalar Field Generator Output
        Adjust Cryogenic System Flow Rate

    Log All Values
    Wait 1 ms
END WHILE

3. Recommended PID Constants (Tuned for IX-Sho-Nuff System)
Variable	P Value	I Value	D Value	Notes
Phase Angle	0.75	0.15	0.05	For ±0.06° phase lock
Resonance Frequency	1.2	0.3	0.1	Acoustic PID tuning

4. Real-World Deployment Notes
Loop Speed:
Minimum control loop cycle rate: 1 ms per complete pass.

Redundancy:
All sensor inputs must include dual-channel redundancy.

Field Safety:
System must disengage all power channels if phase lock deviates more than ±0.2° for over 5 seconds.
