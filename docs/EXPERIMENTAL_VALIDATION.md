# IX-Sho-Nuff Experimental Validation Protocol

This document outlines the complete experimental procedure used to validate the real-world functionality of the IX-Sho-Nuff system.

---

## Purpose

To provide verifiable, reproducible evidence that:

- Element 115 decay is suppressed using the IX-Sho-Nuff system.
- Field stability is achieved across all core subsystems.
- Output energy and resonance patterns align with Tesla 3-6-9 principle targets.

---

## Required Equipment

- IX-Sho-Nuff hardware stack (see BOM)
- Spectrum analyzer (minimum 10 MHz bandwidth)
- High-speed oscilloscope (≥100 MHz sample rate)
- Cryogenic temperature logging unit (Helium-3/4 compatible)
- Geiger counter or equivalent radiation measurement device (if testing actual Element 115 proxy materials)
- Precision frequency counter
- Data logging PC with USB or serial interface

## Procedure Outline

### Step 1: System Pre-Check
- Inspect all coil connections and shielding.
- Verify FPGA firmware version is correct and up to date.
- Calibrate cryogenic system; ensure baseline temp reading under 0.1 K.

### Step 2: Baseline Resonance Scan
- Power on Tesla coil primaries only.
- Log frequency response sweep from **200 kHz to 3 MHz**.
- Record EM field probe data at 1 ms resolution.

### Step 3: Triostrut/Gankyil Activation
- Engage both Triostrut and Gankyil layers.
- Monitor system for field lock:
  - Target phase delta within **±0.05%**.
  - Vibration shift < **5 Hz drift over 60 seconds**.

### Step 4: Cryogenic Stabilization
- Lower core temperature while coils remain active.
- Validate thermal stability window:
  - Temperature fluctuation under ±0.005 K for 10 continuous minutes.

### Step 5: Proxy Material Testing (Bismuth Core)
- Insert bismuth proxy core into system.
- Monitor for:
  - Reduction in EM drift.
  - Stabilization field strength increase (target: 15–20% stronger than empty chamber baseline).

### Step 6: Radiation Suppression Monitoring (Optional)
- If using Element 115 or equivalent isotope:
  - Monitor decay signature changes.
  - Record radiation data pre- and post-stabilization field activation.

### Step 7: Data Logging and Review
- Export all logged data to structured CSV or JSON files.
- Verify that:
  - Field lock was maintained.
  - Cryogenic stability was achieved.
  - EM resonance patterns matched design targets.

## Reporting

All experimental results must be packaged as:

- Raw CSV or JSON data files
- Summary logs in `/logs/` directory
- Direct cross-reference with firmware versions and hardware build specs in `/docs/BOM.md` and `/src/control_systems/`

---

## Notes

This validation procedure is structured to comply with real-world reproducibility standards required for government/military-grade technology evaluation.

By following this protocol exactly, independent validation teams should be able to confirm IX-Sho-Nuff’s stabilization capabilities using standard laboratory equipment.
