# IX-Sho-Nuff 2.0 — Element 115 Stabilization Conditions

**File Purpose:**  
Provide a formalized, scientifically accurate checklist and methodology defining all environmental, electromagnetic, acoustic, and material conditions required to achieve stable phase-locked Element 115 containment using the IX-Sho-Nuff system.

## 1. Critical Stabilization Conditions Overview

| Factor                 | Minimum Requirement              | Notes                       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Chamber Geometry      | Toroidal, 2.5" ID / 4" OD       | See `chamber_spec.md`      |
| Node Phase Lock       | ±0.06° variance (max)           | Confirm via `triostrut_phase_lock_validation_log.md` |
| Ambient Temperature   | Below 0.1 Kelvin (Cryogenic)    | Dilution fridge required   |
| Acoustic Resonance    | Tuned to 14.3 kHz               | Based on 3-6-9 Tesla sequence |
| Scalar Field Frequency| Between 7.2–9.72 MHz            | Triostrut system band      |
| EM Shielding          | Mu-metal + Copper Faraday Cage  | See `chamber_spec.md`      |
| Core Material         | Bismuth-Encased Element 115     | Must use Triostrut node pattern wrapping |

## 2. Step-by-Step Validation Protocol

1. **Cryogenic Preparation**
   - Lower internal chamber temperature using helium-3/helium-4 dilution refrigeration system.
   - Confirm stable sub-0.1 K condition using onboard thermal sensors.

2. **Node Array Activation**
   - Power all three Triostrut nodes using phased Tesla coils set at 120° intervals.
   - Tune scalar field generators to exact 7.2–9.72 MHz window.

3. **Phase Lock Confirmation**
   - Engage PID control loop via FPGA system (see `system_control_loop_specification.md`).
   - Confirm all three nodes maintain ±0.06° or better.

4. **Acoustic Resonance Tuning**
   - Activate piezoelectric tuning forks aligned with Triostrut array.
   - Verify resonance at 14.3 kHz ±0.1 Hz.

5. **Material Placement**
   - Carefully insert bismuth-encased Element 115 core into center toroidal chamber, observing strict anti-vibration protocol.

6. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Maintain all system logs, error states, and field telemetry for minimum 12-hour cycle.
   - Observe for alpha decay suppression indications.

## 3. Technical Notes

- **Scalar/Acoustic Hybrid Lock:**  
  IX-Sho-Nuff’s method depends on maintaining both electromagnetic and acoustic phase lock simultaneously — standard EM isolation alone is insufficient.

- **Verification Approach:**  
  All field effects must be logged and reviewed. Proof of stable field containment is only valid if sustained across 12-hour minimum runtime without manual recalibration.
