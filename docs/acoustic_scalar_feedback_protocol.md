# IX-Sho-Nuff 2.0 — Acoustic Scalar Feedback Protocol

**File Purpose:**  
To describe the exact sensor grid feedback logic and acoustic-scanning procedure necessary for stabilizing Element 115 using Sho’Nuff’s verified system architecture. This file specifically addresses how scalar fields and acoustic vibration fields are measured and adjusted in real time.

---

## 1. Background Context

Sho’Nuff’s field stabilization operates by maintaining:

- **Triostrut Node Phase Lock** (Scalar Field Stability)
- **Acoustic Resonance Matching** (Elemental Lattice Stability)

Failure to maintain both causes field collapse or decay.

---

## 2. Hardware Required

- **Piezoelectric Sensor Grid:**  
  8x8 Array minimum, Quartz or Tourmaline elements.

- **Microcontroller / FPGA Feedback Unit:**  
  Same control unit defined in `/docs/system_control_loop_specification.md`.

- **Coil Driver System:**  
  Tesla resonance system tuned within 7–10 MHz.

- **Temperature Monitoring:**  
  Cryogenic system — helium-3/helium-4 mix.

## 3. Feedback Logic Protocol (Operational Flow)

1. **Sensor Grid Initialization:**  
   - All piezo elements polled for baseline resonance at startup.

2. **Scalar + Acoustic Field Synchronization:**  
   - Sensor outputs combined with scalar field phase data.
   - Look for acoustic standing wave peaks matching calculated harmonic lock points.

3. **Deviation Correction:**  
   - If any sensor point deviates beyond ±0.06° scalar phase or ±0.2 kHz acoustic resonance:
     - Engage PID loop adjustment of Tesla coil drive AND acoustic emitter.

4. **Dynamic Field Memory:**  
   - Store optimized phase/resonance settings in real-time using FPGA volatile RAM.
   - Reactivate saved profile on system reboot.

5. **Emergency Fail-Safe:**  
   - Automatic shutdown if triple sensor node discrepancy occurs lasting longer than 5 seconds.

## 4. Example Control Logic Snapshot

```plaintext
[PID Loop Cycle #1024]
Sensor Grid Peak: 14.302 kHz
Scalar Field Phase: 119.97°
Target Peak: 14.300 kHz ±0.2
Target Phase: 120.00° ±0.06

Deviation Detected — Correcting...
New Coil Drive Setting: +0.0001V
New Acoustic Driver Setting: -0.001 dB

Cycle Complete.

## 5. Experimental Notes
Sensor grid layout must prioritize proximity to Element 115 containment core.

Acoustic coupling improves with increased piezo density.

Phase lock and acoustic lock should always be evaluated in tandem.
