## 3. Summary Results

- **Phase Lock Accuracy Achieved:**  
  Sustained ±0.05° or better over 12-hour test cycle.

- **Environmental Stability:**

## 4. Notes for Replication

- Test must be repeated with identical hardware spec outlined in `/docs/system_control_loop_specification.md`.  
- FPGA PID constants may require re-tuning based on coil construction tolerances.
