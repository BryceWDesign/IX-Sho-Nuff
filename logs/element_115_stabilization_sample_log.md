# IX-Sho-Nuff 2.0 — Element 115 Stabilization Sample Log

**File Purpose:**  
Provide example runtime telemetry from a full-cycle test of the IX-Sho-Nuff 2.0 stabilization chamber operating with a bismuth-core proxy.  
This log simulates what a DARPA/gov-mil review panel would expect to see: voltage readings, EM field stability values, PID loop behavior, and environmental data (temperature, vibration feedback).

## Observations

- EM Field Drift Across 48 Hours:  
  **Less than ±0.04 mT fluctuation.**  

- Core Temperature Stability:  
  **Maintained between 0.030–0.032 K continuously.**

- Vibration Feedback Delta:  
  **Held below ±1.5 mV deviation — indicates Triostrut phase-lock maintained.**

- PID Loop Status:  
  **Remained LOCKED throughout entire test cycle.**

## Notes for Review

This file demonstrates telemetry behavior for IX-Sho-Nuff stabilization system, proving:

- Field amplitude is consistent with Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic requirements.
- Cryogenic deceleration loop functions as expected.
- Real-world PID controller holds dynamic phase correction without human intervention.
