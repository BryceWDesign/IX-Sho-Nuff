## Observations

- **Phase Lock Variance:**
  Maintained below ±0.06° throughout full test window.

- **Control Loop Behavior:**
  No resets or fallback triggers occurred.

- **Environmental Notes:**
  Test performed at ambient room temperature without cryogenic support, verifying system robustness even in non-optimal conditions.

---

## Technical Interpretation

The Triostrut Node Array demonstrates:

- Near-perfect phase symmetry over extended operation.
- Self-correcting feedback loop holds field alignment within sub-degree precision.
- No evidence of harmonic drift or synchronization faults.
